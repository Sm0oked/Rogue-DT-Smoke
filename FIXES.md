# Rogue Death Trap Script - Fixes Log

## Latest Fixes (2024-07-06)

### Boss Exception for Minimum Enemy Count

**New Feature:** Added logic to bypass the minimum enemy count threshold when a boss enemy is present, ensuring optimal spell usage in boss fights.

**Files Modified:**
- `main.lua` - Added boss check in the `evaluate_targets` function
- `death_trap.lua` - Added boss exception to enemy count check
- `poison_trap.lua` - Implemented boss detection logic
- `dance_of_knives.lua` - Added boss bypass for minimum enemy threshold
- `rain_of_arrows.lua` - Added boss exception logic
- `caltrop.lua` - Implemented boss detection for enemy count override
- `penetrating_shot.lua` - Added boss exception to minimum enemy check

**Technical Details:**
- Added a `boss_present` boolean flag that checks if `boss_units_count > 0`
- Modified conditional checks to bypass minimum enemy count when a boss is present
- Maintained keybind override functionality alongside the new boss detection
- Added debug output in some spells to indicate when boss detection is triggering the bypass

### Minimum Enemy Count Threshold Fix

**Issue:** The script was ignoring the minimum enemy count setting when elite/champion enemies were present, causing suboptimal spell usage in many scenarios.

**Files Fixed:**
- `main.lua` - Added global check in the `evaluate_targets` function
- `death_trap.lua` - Implemented effective threshold check
- `poison_trap.lua` - Added minimum enemy count validation
- `dance_of_knives.lua` - Added global minimum enemy count check
- `rain_of_arrows.lua` - Fixed minimum enemy threshold logic
- `caltrop.lua` - Added proper enemy count validation
- `penetrating_shot.lua` - Fixed enemy count check logic

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented consistent checking of `all_units_count` against the effective minimum threshold
- Created an `effective_min_enemies` variable that uses the higher value between global and spell-specific settings
- Added keybind override functionality to allow manual casting regardless of enemy count
- Added debug output for easier verification of enemy counting process

### Error Handling Improvements

- Added robust error handling with pcall for evade spell registration
- Enhanced parameter validation for all spell functions
- Improved error reporting for easier troubleshooting
- Fixed missing parameters in register_circular_spell and register_rectangular_spell calls

### Performance Optimizations

- Implemented early returns when minimum enemy count requirements aren't met
- Reduced unnecessary spell evaluations with better early checks
- Improved caching of enemy count results to avoid redundant calculations
- Enhanced targeting refresh logic to reduce CPU load

## Testing Verification

To verify these fixes are working correctly:
1. Set the minimum enemy count to a higher value (e.g., 4 or 5)
2. Enter an area with scattered enemies where no clusters meet this threshold
3. Confirm that spells are not cast, even when elite/champion enemies are present
4. Use keybind mode with "Keybind Ignores Min Hits" enabled to verify manual override works
5. Fight a boss with minimum enemy count set high and verify spells are cast despite not meeting the threshold

These fixes ensure the script follows the user's configured minimum enemy count settings more consistently, resulting in better resource management and improved overall performance.

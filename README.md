# Rogue-SmokeEdit

Main Changes:

1. **Dash Integration:**
   - Added `dash` to the main spell rotation, so it is now cast regularly for mobility and Momentum stacking.

2. **Momentum Stacking Phase:**
   - Added a phase at the start of combat to cast `dash` and `shadow_step` repeatedly until you reach max Momentum stacks (using the correct buff hash: `391681`).

3. **Shadow Imbuement Logic:**
   - Set Shadow Imbuement to always cast when available (priority mode = "Always", min_enemies = 1) for aggressive uptime.

4. **Spell Rotation Order:**
   - Ensured the spell order and logic now closely follow the Pit Push/Speedfarm guide, prioritizing mobility, imbuement, and Death Trap as described.
